# 90DaysDSA

This repo is used to track my progress through a 90 day challenge of studying data structures and algorithms. 

The challenge is inspired by Nishant Chahar

## Plan

This is the general guideline for how I expect my efforts to go, based on the video link above. Of course this is subject to change, but I believe that having some idea of where you are going is better than none.

## Diary 

Day 1:
- Learned the fundamentals of time complexity (variable assignment, for loops, if-then statements)
- Learned the time complexity of `list` operations in Python.
- Worked through [these](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/computer-science/big-o-notation-and-binary-trees/big-o-practice) exercises, first converting to Python functions from the original JavaScript, and then doing the time complexity analysis.
