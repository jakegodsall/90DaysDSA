# 90DaysDSA

This repo is used to track my progress through a 90 day challenge of studying data structures and algorithms. 

The challenge is inspired by Nishant Chahar

## Plan

This is the general guideline for how I expect my efforts to go, based on the video link above. Of course this is subject to change, but I believe that having some idea of where you are going is better than none.

## Diary 

__06/08/2022__ (Day 1):
- Learned the fundamentals of time complexity (variable assignment, for loops, if-then statements)
- Learned the time complexity of `list` operations in Python.
- Worked through [these](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/computer-science/big-o-notation-and-binary-trees/big-o-practice) exercises, first converting to Python functions from the original JavaScript, and then doing the time complexity analysis. [Solutions](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day1/BigOPractice.ipynb)

__07/08/2022__ (Day 2):
- Created a function for reversing values in an `Array` in Java and done time complexity analysis. [Here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day2/reverse-array/src/Main.java).
- Created a function for finding the minimum value in an `Array` in Java and done time complexity analysis. [Here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day2/min-element-array/src/Main.java).
- Completed chapter 1 and chapter 2 of _The Recursive Book of Recursion_. Notebooks [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/tree/main/recursion-textbook).
- Solved leetcode problem 492 using iterative solution [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/construct-the-rectangle/).
