# 90DaysDSA

This repo is used to track my progress through a 90 day challenge of studying data structures and algorithms. 

The challenge is inspired by Nishant Chahar

## Plan

This is the general guideline for how I expect my efforts to go, based on the video link above. Of course this is subject to change, but I believe that having some idea of where you are going is better than none.

## Diary 

__06/08/2022__ (Day 1):
- Learned the fundamentals of time complexity (variable assignment, for loops, if-then statements)
- Learned the time complexity of `list` operations in Python.
- Worked through [these](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/computer-science/big-o-notation-and-binary-trees/big-o-practice) exercises, first converting to Python functions from the original JavaScript, and then doing the time complexity analysis. [Solutions](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day1/BigOPractice.ipynb)

__07/08/2022__ (Day 2):
- Created a function for reversing values in an `Array` in Java and done time complexity analysis. [Here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day2/reverse-array/Main.java).
- Created a function for finding the minimum value in an `Array` in Java and done time complexity analysis. [Here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day2/min-element-array/Main.java).
- Completed chapter 1 and chapter 2 of _The Recursive Book of Recursion_. Notebooks [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/tree/main/recursion-textbook).

__08/08/2022__ (Day 3):
- Completed chapter 1 of _Introduction to Recursive Programming_.
- Created an iterative-based greatest common divider function in Java [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day3/gcd-iterative/Main.java)
- Created an recursive-based greatest common divider function in Java [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day3/gcd-recursive/Main.java)
- Solved leetcode problem 492. construct the rectangle. Solution [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day3/leetcode492/Main.java)

__09/08/2022__ (Day 4):
- Comlpeted chapter 4.1-4.4 of _Data Structures and Algorithms in Python_.

- Spend one hour total solving basic algorithm problems on HackerRank.

__14/08/2022__ (Day 7):
- Completed two sections of chapter 5, Array-based Sequences of _Data Structures and Algorithms in Python_.
- Created a DynamicArray class which mimics the interface for the list sequence in Python [here](https://github.com/jakegodsall/90DaysDSA/blob/main/day6/python%20array-based-sequences.ipynb)

__15/08/2022__ (Day 8):
